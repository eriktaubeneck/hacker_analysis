\section{Hacker School Analysis Seminar - Sequences}

\subsection{Attribution}

Much of the content is closely adapted from
\href{http://books.google.com/books/about/Elementary_Analysis.html?id=ZDaSnKr_k5sC}{Elementary
Analysis: The Theory of Calculus} by Kenneth Ross. This book, or others
on mathematical analysis, should be consulted for further inquiry.

\subsection{Useful Properties}

\subsubsection{Archimedean Property}

\paragraph{Claim:}

\emph{If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$na > b$.}

In essence, this states that no matter how small of an $a$ and how large
of a $b$ we choose, we can always find an integer multiple of $a$ that
will exceed $b$.

\paragraph{Proof:}

Suppose, by way of contradiction, that the Archimedean property fails.
Then there exists $a>0$ and $b>0$ such that $na \le b$ for all
$n in \mathbb{N}$. By definition, $b$ is then an upper bound on the set
$S = \{na : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

Using the completeness axiom, let $s_0 = \sup S$. Since $a > 0$, we have
$s_0 < s_0 + a$, so $s_0 - a < s_0$. Since $s_0$ is the least upper
bound of $S$, $s_0 - a$ cannot be an upper bound of $S$. This implies
that there exists an $s = n_0 a \in S$ such that $s_0 - a < n_0 a$ for
some $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$. Adding $a$ to each side of the inequality, we
get $s_0 < (n_0 + 1) a$. Since $n_0 + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$,
$(n_0 +1) a \in S$, and so $s_0$ is not an upper bound for $S$.
Contradiction. $\mathbb{QED}$.

\subsubsection{Denseness of $\mathbb{Q}$}

\paragraph{Claim:}

\emph{If $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a<b$, then there exists a rational
number $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $a < r < b$.}

\paragraph{Pseudo-Proof:}

We need to show that $a < \frac{m}{n} < b$ for some
$m,n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $n > 0$. Thus, we need

\[ an < m < bn \]

Since $b-a > 0$, the Archimedean property shows that there exists an
$n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n(b-a) > 1$. Thus, $bn - an > 1$, and so
it is \emph{fairly evident} that there exists an $m$ between $an$ and
$bn$, so our claim holds. (Actually \emph{proving} that this $m$ exists
is a bit more delicate, see page 24/25 in Ross for more detail.)

\subsection{Sequences}

Formally, a \emph{sequence} is a function from
$\{ n \in \mathbb{Z}: n \ge m\}$, where $m$ is usually 0 or 1, into
$\mathbb{R}$. However, it is customary to write $s_n$ rather than
$s(n)$, and is also convenient to write $(s_n)_{n=m}^{\infty}$,
$(s_m, s_{m+1}, s_{m+2})$, or, when $m = 1$, $(s_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.

\subsubsection{Examples}

(a). Consider the sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where
$a_n = \frac{1}{n^2}$. This is the sequence
$(1, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{25}, ...)$.
Formally this is the function with domain $\mathbb{N}$ with value
$\frac{1}{n^2}$ for each $n$. The \emph{set} of values is
$\{1, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{25}, ...\}$.

(b). Consider the sequence $(b_n)_{n = 0}^{\infty}$ where
$b_n = (-1)^n$. The sequence is $(1,-1,1,-1,...)$, however its
\emph{set} of values is $\{-1,1\}$.

It's important to distinguish between a sequence and its set of values,
and we will always use parentheses $( \ )$ to signify a sequence and
braces $\{ \ \}$ to signify a set.

(c). Consider the sequence $(c_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where
$c_n = (1 + \frac{1}{n})^n$. This is the sequence
$(2, (\frac{3}{2})^2, (\frac{4}{3})^3, (\frac{5}{4})^4, ...)$, or
approximately

\[ (2, 2.25, 2.3704, 2.4414, 2.4883, 2.5216, 2.5465, 2.5658, ...). \]

$c_{100}$ is approximately 2.7048, and $c_{1000}$ is approximately
2.7169.

\subsubsection{Limits}

The \emph{limit} of a sequence $(s_n)$ is a real number which the values
$s_n$ are ``close'' to for large values of $n$. In example (a), the
values are ``close'' to 0 for large $n$, and in example (c), the values
are close to Euler's constant, $e$, for large $n$. However, example (b)
doesn't seem to get close to any number, but instead jumps between $-1$
and $1$. As we'll see in the following definition, a \emph{limit} will
require the sequence values to be close to the limit value for
\emph{all} large $n$, so neither $1$ or $-1$ will be limits of $(c_n)$.

\paragraph{Definition:}

A sequence $(s_n)$ of real numbers is said to \emph{converge} to the
real number $s$ if and only if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a
number $N$ such that $n>N$ such that $\vert s_n - s\vert  < \epsilon$
for all $n > N$.
